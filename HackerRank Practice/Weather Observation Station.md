### Weather Observation Station
The STATION table is described as follows:

|  Field | Type |
|---|---|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| CITY | VARCHAR2(21)   |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N |  NUMBER |
| LONG_W | NUMBER |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

11. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY,1,1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') OR LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY),1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');   
```
