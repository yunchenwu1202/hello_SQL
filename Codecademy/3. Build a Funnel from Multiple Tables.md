### Build a Funnel from Multiple Tables

Scenario: Mattresses and More sells bedding essentials from their e-commerce store. Their purchase funnel is:

The user browses products and adds them to their cart
The user proceeds to the checkout page
The user enters credit card information and makes a purchase
Three steps! Simple and easy.

As a sales analyst, you want to examine data from the shopping days before Christmas. As Christmas approaches, you suspect that customers become more likely to purchase items in their cart (i.e., they move from window shopping to buying presents).

The data for Mattresses and More is spread across several tables:

browse - each row in this table represents an item that a user has added to his shopping cart
checkout - each row in this table represents an item in a cart that has been checked out
purchase - each row in this table represents an item that has been purchased

1. Letâ€™s examine each table. Note that each user has multiple rows representing the different items that she has placed in her cart.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM browse
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM checkout
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM purchase
LIMIT 5;
```
