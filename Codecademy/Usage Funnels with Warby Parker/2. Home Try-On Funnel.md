1. Warby Parker’s purchase funnel is:

Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses

During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:

50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on
Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.

The data will be distributed across three tables:

quiz
home_try_on
purchase

Examine the first five rows of each table

What are the column names?

```sql

SELECT *
FROM quiz
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM home_try_on
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM purchase
LIMIT 5;
```

2. We’d like to create a new table with the following layout:

user_id	is_home_try_on	number_of_pairs	is_purchase
4e8118dc	True	3	False
291f1cca	True	5	False
75122300	False	NULL	False

Each row will represent a single user from the browse table:

If the user has any entries in home_try_on, then is_home_try_on will be True.
number_of_pairs comes from home_try_on table
If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.
Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel (purchase).

Select only the first 10 rows from this table (otherwise, the query will run really slowly).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT q.user_id,
   h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_home_try_on',
   h.number_of_pairs,
   p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
FROM quiz q
LEFT JOIN home_try_on h
   ON q.user_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase p
   ON p.user_id = q.user_id
LIMIT 10;
```
